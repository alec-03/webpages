    <p>Anyone who has been skiing with a large group has experienced losing sight of their friends on the slope. The current best way to reunite with your crew is to dig through your thermal layers to find your phone and check Life360 or call them, but the majority of the time they are still skiing, don't hear their phone, don't have signal, etc. etc. etc. I just want to know what we're having for lunch!</p>

    This project is still a work-in-progress, but I've made a lot of interesting developments along the way. I used my data science class final project as an excuse to write a dead-reckoning Kalman filter <a href="images/KalmanFilteringGPSData.pdf">(Report PDF)</a> that I can use on both the user's GPS data and on the user's friend's transmitted GPS data to smoothly interpolate between position updates.

    My current task for this project is my GPS data sharing protocol. I opted for LoRa radio devices for communication and am working on a flood-routing protocol so that all friends can find all other friends.
