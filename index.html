								<p>Hello! My name is Alec Henderson. I am currently a Junior at NC State University studying computer science. My major areas of study are in computer networks and software security.</p>
								<p>In my free time I enjoy photography (some of which you can find <a href="#gallery"><b>here</b></a>), tennis (I'm alright), and programming (I'm pretty good). You can find my programming coursework and side projects <a href="#projects"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

								</center>

								<p>If you have spent any time on TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube shorts, you will have stumbled upon a video like the one shown above: A narrator reading a story from Reddit aloud while video game footage plays in the background. After seeing about a dozen of these, the computer scientist within me wondered if these videos could be automated to any extent. Thus began a programming journey that would occupy me for a good portion of my summer--the finished product being a system that can churn out videos (including the one above) without any user input.</p>
								<p>The top level design was simple: Find a Reddit post online, have a narrator read the content of the post aloud, tack the audio over some game footage, and then upload the finished product online. The low-level design was intentionally very complex--I wanted to see just how much I had learned after my sophomore year. My project started with the narrator. These types of posts often use a very robotic voice, but I wanted something better. I elected to use the tortoiseTTS API, a library for training and using an AI voice synthesizer on CUDA systems. I trained my model on podcasts made by a YouTuber I watch, an example is embedded below.</p>
								<center>
									<iframe width="100%" height="320px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsZzKzGdgTo" title="Hepatitis From Possibly Contaminated Alkaline Water" frameborder="0""></iframe>
								</center>
								<p>As you can see the resemblance is uncanny. An exhaustive list of the rest of the features and libraries I used would be far too long, so I have listed only the most interesting below.</p>
								<h5>Interprocess Communication</h5>	
								<p>I maintained what I called a "live set" as an independent process that would stay alive for the duration of the programs execution. The live set would maintain a Red-Black tree that represented the set of all Reddit post IDs that the program has already created a post for, and I could query the live set for IDs to see if they had already been used. The motivation behind this is mostly theoretical: as the size of the set of visited posts grows, it becomes increasingly less efficient to search through a text file for the post ID. However, using an RB tree we can significantly reduce the time checking for duplicates.</p>
								<p>The original audio created by the tortoiseTTS library is a little slow for my taste. Surprisingly, there is not a very good python library for tweaking the tempo of audio files. Thankfully, the FOSS audio manipulation program Audacity provides a mechanism for IPC via pipes, which I used to program macros to load, adjust, and then export my tweaked audio very quickly.</p>								
								<h5>Video manipulation</h5>
								<p>Getting the video content right was by far the most difficult part. All parts of the text captions had to be done manually: For every frame I had to determine what sentence was being played at said frame, calculate newlines and padding for the most "square" block of text, and then calculate where in frame the text block should lay. I used a dynamic programming approach to solve this, since the answer was effectively the same for the duration of the sentence being played.</p>
								<p>Once the captions were done I had to sort out the titlecards, which are also handled entirely by my program. The de facto standard is to use the Reddit post header as the video title, but since I was getting these posts via an HTML scraper, this would be very hard to obtain from the source. I ended up handling this by scraping for more content from the HTML page, and I am quite pleased with the results.</p>
								
								
								<h3 class="major">AES Encryption Algorithm</h3>
								<span class="image main"> 
									<a href="images/round.png" target="_blank" title="Click to view in a new tab">
										<img src="images/round.png" alt="" />
									</a>
								</span>
								<p>This project looked daunting at first but ended up being one of my favorites to date. AES was invented by two guys in Belgium, but the US government liked it so much that now they use it to encrypt almost anything that matters</p>
								<p>The details are far too sophistocated to describe all the particulars of, but simply, the algorithm takes a 16-byte key and does some clever bit-level manipulation and linear algebra to generate the encrypted result. This can be run several times to create an encrypted file that gets progressively harder to crack. The linear algebra bits allow keys that can expire, meaning that with only a few tweaks, I could make it so that this program encrypts files that are impossible to decrypt even with the key after some time!</p>

									</a>
								</span>
								<p>Here is the result of our algorithm ran with 10 passes on a picture of my girlfriend's chinchilla, Apple. after encrypting and decrypting apple we can see that the result matches the input exactly!</p>
								
								
								
								<h3 class="major">Ident (grep clone)</h3>
								<span class="image main">

											  <source src="images/ident.mp4" type="video/mp4">
											  Your browser does not support the video tag.
										</video> 
									</a>
								</span>
								<p>We had several projects in my C/C++ development class, but this one was one of my favorites.</p>
								<p>Ident is essentially a clone of grep that parses a document for a string (no regex yet!) and prints the lines in which the string occurs to standard out.</p>
								<p>The program can also has many flags as you can see in the demo, -c [x] will show 'x' lines of context above and below, -n will print line numbers, and -o was the extra credit, this highlights all c operators.</p>
								<p>If it were up to me, I would want -o to highlight all C keywords too, but I dont write the rules!</p>
								
								<h3 class="major">PackScheduler</h3>
								<span class="image main"> 
									<a href="images/Packscheduler.mp4" target="_blank" title="Click to view in a new tab">
										<video width="100%" autoplay muted>
											  <source src="images/Packscheduler.mp4" type="video/mp4">
											  Your browser does not support the video tag.
										</video> 
									</a>
								</span>
								<p>This was the semester-long lab project that required a new functionality every week. Packscheduler can manage the schedules of students, faculty, and the whole school when signed in as the registrar.</p>
								<p>In my opinion this was an amazing introduction to working on a large system, because every 3 weeks we would change lab partners. This resulted in code that likely half of the class had worked on at some point, due to different implementations being worked on every month.</p>
								<p>It was not unlikely that at some point you would have to debug code written by someone in another group after a bug is found 7 weeks later.</p>
								
								<h3 class="major">Test Plan Software</h3>
								<span class="image main">
									<a href="images/STP1.png" target="_blank" title="Click to view in a new tab">
										<img src="images/STP1.png" alt="" />
									</a>
								</span>
								<p>My final project in my Software Development Fundimentals class was a program that can manage the System Test Plans for several programs that a developer / tester could be working on.</p>
								<span class="image main"> 
									<a href="images/STP2.mp4" target="_blank" title="Click to view in a new tab">

											  <source src="images/STP2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
											  Your browser does not support the video tag.
										</video> 
									</a>
								</span>
								<p>This is my design and implementation of the program. The learning outcome of this project was to cement our understanding of linear data structures including custom array and linked lists. I'm particularly proud of my LinkedList implementation which maintains a sorted order as elements are added</p>
								
								<h3 class="major">Software Development Requirements Manager</h3>
								<span class="image main">
									<a href="images/ReqMan2.png" target="_blank" title="Click to view in a new tab">
										<img src="images/ReqMan2.png" alt="" />
									</a>
								</span>
								<p>As a part of my Software Development Fundamentals class, we were instructed to design and then implement a program that could manage several "user stories"--low level abstractions of what a program in development should do. We all were required to implement a finite state machine in our programs, with each state representing a phase of development of any particular story.</p>
								<span class="image main">
									<a href="images/ReqMan1.jpg" target="_blank" title="Click to view in a new tab">
										<img src="images/ReqMan1.jpg" alt="" />
									</a>
								</span>								<p>This is my implementation of the program, it implements both the state pattern and the singleton pattern, and has full file IO capabilities. Perhaps I should start using this in my future projects!</p>
